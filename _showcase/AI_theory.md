                    I predict that AI will not converge to a single unifying theory. 
                    Instead, it will resemble physics, where multiple frameworks coexist—classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, relativity—each with its own principles and experiments. 
                    In AI, reinforcement learning, deep learning, large language models, diffusion models, and pure theory will continue to evolve along their own paths, with engineering applications building on top of them much like aerodynamics builds on fluid mechanics without reduction to quantum theory.

                    This pluralism implies freedom: each subfield can open new ground, create its own concepts, and progress independently. 
                    A grand unified AI theory may remain as elusive as unifying the four fundamental forces or proving $P \neq NP$, but researchers can still pioneer within domains and push frontiers forward piece by piece.
