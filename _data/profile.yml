  <p>
    I am a second-year master's student at the University of Pennsylvania.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have a profound interest in AI, encompassing theoretical, empirical, and even philosophical aspects. 
    My current research focuses on LLM understanding (mechanisms, theory), optimization (acceleration, efficiency), and trustworthiness (safety, privacy, interpretability).
    I’m also open to exploring RAG, RLHF, agents, reasoning, and alignment.

  <p>
  I am happy to chat on everything. Feel free to contact.
