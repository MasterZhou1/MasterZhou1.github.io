  <p>
    I am a 1st year CS PhD student at the Duke University.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am broadly interested in AI, spanning theoretical, empirical, and even philosophical aspects.  
    My current research focuses on understanding *how* and *why* advanced AI models such as large language models and diffusion models work, and on using this understanding to make them more accurate, efficient, and robust.  
    I am also interested in related areas where stronger foundations may open up exciting applications, ranging from trustworthy AI to agentic intelligence and AI for science.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am happy to chat on everything. Feel free to contact.
