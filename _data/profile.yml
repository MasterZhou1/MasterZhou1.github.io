  <p>
    I am a 1st year CS PhD student at Duke University.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>I study the foundations of advanced AI models, focusing on how and why they work.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    My current research centers on understanding <em>how</em> and <em>why</em> advanced AI models—such as large language models and diffusion models—work, and on leveraging this understanding to make them more accurate, efficient, and robust.  
    More broadly, I am interested in AI across theoretical, empirical, and even philosophical dimensions, as well as in areas where stronger foundations may unlock exciting applications, from trustworthy AI to agentic intelligence and AI for science.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am always open to discussions. Feel free to reach out.
