  We present the first differential privacy (DP) data structure for cross-attention modules—securing sensitive information in key and value matrices across AI applications like retrieval-augmented generation and guided stable diffusion—with theoretical guarantees on privacy and efficiency, robustness to adaptive attacks, and potential to inspire future privacy designs in large generative models.
