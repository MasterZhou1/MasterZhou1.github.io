  We provide a theoretical analysis showing that for diffusion models with Gaussian mixture data, the diffusion process preserves the mixture structure; we derive tight, component-independent bounds on Lipschitz constants and second moments, and establish error guarantees for diffusion solversâ€”offering deeper insights into the diffusion dynamics under common data distributions.
