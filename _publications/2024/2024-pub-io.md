abstract: >-
  We establish tight I/O complexity bounds for attention mechanisms in large language models across small and large cache sizesâ€”confirming FlashAttention's optimality in large caches, improving algorithms for small caches, extending analysis to sparse attention, and offering insights for efficient LLM training and inference.
