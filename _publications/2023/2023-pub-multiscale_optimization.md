  We develop a multiscale optimization framework for graded lattice structures—both non-stochastic and stochastic—by modeling microstructures, optimizing macroscopic relative density, and reconstructing full-scale lattices, demonstrating mechanical advantages over traditional single-scale structures through analysis and experiments.
