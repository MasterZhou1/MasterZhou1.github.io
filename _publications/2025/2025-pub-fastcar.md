abstract: >-
  FastCar is a unified framework that accelerates auto-regressive video generation by leveraging temporal redundancy in MLP outputs through a Temporal Attention Score (TAS), enabling selective reuse of computations, integrating with sparse attention to mitigate drifting, and supporting real-time, high-resolution synthesis on edge devices via a TAS-guided Dynamic Resource Scheduling (DRS) FPGA accelerator, achieving over 2.1Ã— speedup and improved efficiency with minimal quality loss.
