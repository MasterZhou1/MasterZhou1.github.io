abstract: >-
  We propose FastCar, a unified framework that accelerates auto-regressive video generation by exploiting temporal redundancy through a Temporal Attention Score for selective computation reuse, integrating with sparse attention and dynamic scheduling to enable real-time, high-resolution synthesis with over 2.1Ã— speedup and minimal quality loss.
