abstract: >-
  We analyze why Transformers fail in time-series forecasting through in-context learning theory, proving that, under AR($p$) data, linear self-attention cannot outperform classical linear predictors and suffers a strict $O(1/n)$ excess-risk gap, while chain-of-thought inference compounds errors exponentially—revealing fundamental representational limits of attention and offering principled insights.
