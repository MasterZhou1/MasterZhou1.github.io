## AI Theory: Fragmented but Expansive

*TL;DR — Don’t wait for a “theory of everything.” AI will mature the way physics, biology, and engineering did: via a network of local theories that are right at their scale. That’s good news for progress—and for researchers who can bridge ideas across domains.*

---

### 1) A Personal Prediction

I don’t expect a single grand unifying theory of AI any time soon. The field looks set to evolve like post-Newtonian physics or modern biology: **patchworks of locally powerful laws, models, and intuitions** that each explain part of intelligence under specific assumptions and scales.

- Learning theory, optimization, probabilistic modeling, LLM scaling, diffusion dynamics—each already has its own **objects, invariants, and proof styles**.  
- Convergence might come much later—if at all. For now, **pluralism is a feature, not a bug**: multiple angles sharpen our collective understanding.

---

### 2) Why Unification Is Unlikely (for Now)

Three structural forces keep AI theory plural:

1. **System complexity and heterogeneity**  
   LLMs, diffusion models, tool-using agents, and multi-modal stacks behave differently because they *are* different systems with different bottlenecks.

2. **Scale vs. abstraction mismatch**  
   Techniques that characterize small models (e.g., VC bounds) often lose bite at trillion-parameter scales; statistical-mechanics-style arguments capture trends but miss mechanism-level precision.

3. **Incompatible objectives and constraints**  
   Efficiency, alignment, interpretability, reasoning, privacy, and safety often **pull in orthogonal directions**, requiring different abstractions and evaluation regimes.

**Outcome:** a **pluralistic ecosystem** of theories, each valid in its operating region.

### 3) Analogies That Actually Map

- **Aerodynamics vs. quantum mechanics**  
  Airplanes were designed with aerodynamics (derived from fluid mechanics), not quantum electrodynamics. When engineers compute lift/drag, they use the **right theory at the right scale**—not the deepest theory available.  
  **AI parallel:** RL uses value functions/Bellman operators without reducing everything to backprop; LLM work uses scaling laws without reducing all results to PAC-style generalization.

- **Biology’s layered frameworks**  
  Darwinian evolution explained the *why*, but genetics, molecular biology, and ecology each built **distinct frameworks** that didn’t collapse into one equation.  
  **AI parallel:** “reasoning,” “alignment,” “interpretability,” and “efficiency” develop semi-independently, then meet at the application layer.

---

### 4) What “Fragmented Progress” Looks Like

- **Learning theory**: generalization/regret bounds, stability analyses, compression views.  
- **Optimization**: convergence under non-convexity, saddle dynamics, implicit bias of SGD/Adam.  
- **Representation theory**: approximation capacity, manifold geometry, phase transitions, trajectory analysis.  
- **Empirical science**: scaling laws, emergent abilities, ablation taxonomies.  
- **Interpretability**: circuits, attribution, mechanistic probes; local causal models of behavior.  
- **Systems & efficiency**: KV-cache, quantization/distillation regimes, throughput/latency trade-offs.  
- **Agents**: planning priors, tool-use formalisms, self-consistency dynamics, multi-agent incentives.

Each speaks a completely **different language**; together they form a growing **atlas of intelligence**.

### 5) Counterpoints—and What Would Falsify This

Could we still arrive at a unifying theory of AI? Possibly—but I suspect it would be as difficult as reconciling the four fundamental forces in physics or proving $\mathsf{P} \neq \mathsf{NP}$:

- **A universal invariant** capable of predicting generalization and behavior **across** LLMs, diffusion models, and agents, with **tight error bounds** that hold at practical scales.  
- **A single law of training dynamics**, robust to optimizer choice, data distribution, and architecture, yielding **mechanistic predictions** rather than just statistical trend lines.  
- **A unifying evaluation principle** that integrates alignment, reasoning, and efficiency into a provable frontier of trade-offs, while also matching real-world empirical performance.

Absent breakthroughs of this magnitude, **local theories will continue to dominate**—just as in physics, where the dream of unification remains distant, or in complexity theory, where $\mathsf{P} \stackrel{?}{=} \mathsf{NP}$ endures as one of the hardest open problems: beautiful, profound, but far beyond immediate reach.  

And even if unification someday arrived, **local theories would still remain indispensable**. Civil engineering provides a clear example: for thousands of years, bridges and buildings have been safely designed using simple load-verification formulas that require nothing more than $+,-,\times,\div,\sqrt{\cdot}$. The existence of continuum mechanics or quantum theory does not invalidate these methods—they are simply the *right theory at the right scale*.  

Likewise, in AI, unification would not erase the utility of scaling laws, regret bounds, or optimization heuristics. Each local theory, when applied at the right regime, is both sufficient and enduring.

### 6) Why Fragmentation Is Good (Now)

- **Faster progress**: local theories let us *ship knowledge* without waiting for grand unification.  
- **Creative degrees of freedom**: researchers can found micro-fields with their own objects and benchmarks.  
- **Robustness**: overlapping partial theories reduce the risk of a single paradigm’s blind spots.

> Think “federated science”: many lenses, frequent cross-checks, rapid iteration.

### 7) Where This Leaves AGI

Advances toward AGI will likely **accelerate** this pluralism before they reduce it. As capabilities expand, **new regimes** (long-horizon planning, tool economies, social learning) will demand **new local theories**.

History gives a guide:  
- The **Wright brothers** built a working airplane decades before fluid mechanics matured; commercial aviation scaled on the back of engineering heuristics, not quantum electrodynamics.  
- **AI parallel:** AGI may emerge under scaling laws and empirical recipes first, with deeper theory catching up later. Just as aeronautics eventually systematized after practice, a true unifying AI theory—if possible—may follow only after AGI is already here.

---

### 8) Closing Thought

AI’s scientific richness won’t come from compressing everything into one equation. It will come from **cultivating a network of partial, overlapping theories**—each precise at its scale, each falsifiable in its domain, and each useful for building and understanding intelligent systems.

*Fragmented, but expansive—and that’s exactly how science often wins.*
